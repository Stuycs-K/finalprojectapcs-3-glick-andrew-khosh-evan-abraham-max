### Period: 3

### Group Members: Andrew Glick, Max Abraham, Evan Khosh

### Group Name: CodeSwing Kings

### Project Title: Pitch Please

### Brief Project Description:

We are recreating the baseball mini-game from Friv.com where the player tries to hit a pitched ball at the right time. The goal is to swing at the right moment in order to hit the ball further, giving the runner more time to round the bases.

 ### Expanded Description:

Critical Features (Minimum Viable Product):

These are the features we want working by the 1.5-week MVP deadline:
- Pitcher that throws balls
- Bat that swings on mouse click
- Collision detection to see if the ball is hit
- Each at-bat will result in one of two things: a homerun or an out
- The outcome of each at bat will be determined by the accuracy and timing of the hit
- Batter will be able to strike out and if he gets 4 balls he will get a homerun instead of a walk
- Game resets and keeps score
- Basic UI: score display and game over text
  
Nice to Have Features:
- Different pitch speeds/directions
- Stats for the different Batters/Pitchers (speed, strength, staminda, etc)
- Weather Conditions / Wind Speed
- The ability to have different runners on different bases that will act according to the batter
- Batter will walk when they have four balls(instead of an instant homerun in MVP)
