# IDEAS:


Our first idea is a simulation of an area of land with forests, fields, lakes, etc. In this we would have different classes of creaturs, like humans and orcs, that would be coded to act in different ways. This would be to simulate a few things, but most importantly shared learning. We would code the classes to be able to share knowledge, and see if we could simualte it so that societies can learn things as individuals that pass down through generations.

Our second idea would be to create the game paper.io in which the user would play against multiple other precoded bots on one map that could be viewed in the bottom corner that would display a small version of the entire map and color in each persons territory. There would also be different difficulty options that would change how aggressive and fast the opponents move. https://paperiogame.io/

Our third idea would be to create a baseball game. You would only do offense, and would start as the batter. Here you would choose when and where to swing the bat. You be looking at the view behind the plate towards the pither (like most baseball games). Then, when you get a hit, your view would switch to a top down view of the field. You would control the batter as he ran the bases, and the rest of the players on bases would act accordingly. You could also adjust players to have different stats, like strength for better hits and speed for faster base running. You could also adjuct the difficulty of the game which would change the speed of the pitches and the strength of the defensive players.
